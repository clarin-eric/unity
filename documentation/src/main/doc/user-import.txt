== Automatic user import

Automatic user import, sounds as an important integration feature. However in Unity it is a minor, 
rarely used option. In a typical situation "user import" happens as a side effect of user's 
authentication to Unity, in effect of input translation profile execution, or processing of a registration request.

There is, however, one case when this is not suitable: a so called 3rd party query, i.e. when one service asks 
Unity about another principal. Currently 3rd party query is only available by using the WebSerice (SOAP) SAML endpoint
and its AttributeQuery service. In future additional such options may be added. During 3rd party query the query 
subject is not authenticated (possibly it never logged into Unity) so the authentication facility 
won't be ever activated. Automatic user import can be used in such cases. 

Unity user import feature works as follows:

. When data about an user is requested by a 3rd-party query to any Unity IdP endpoint, before it is resolved from 
the local database the import facility is invoked. 
. The configured importers are tried in order until one finds the requested user or all return nothing.
. Each import works as follows:
.. Data about the user is first fetched from remote data store.
.. It is then postprocessed with a configured input translation profile.

There are two things to note here:

- Import of a user recently checked is not retried for some (configurable) amount of time.
- The translation profile does the actual application of the imported user to Unity database. Therefore the profile 
must CREATE the identity if it is missing. Usage of a profile which only matches a user will simply have no 
effect and is useful merely for testing.

User import is activated by adding one (or more) import configurations in the main unity config as follows:

----
unityServer.core.userImport.1=conf/ldapImport.properties
----

The referenced file must contain import configuration. The configuration is composed from two sections. 
The first one includes all options which are common for all types of importers. Each import is configured with  
the following mandatory setting:

----
unity.userImport.importerType=ldap
unity.userImport.remoteIdpName=Company LDAP
unity.userImport.inputTranslationProfile=ldap-profile
----

The first option selects import implementation, one of the available and documented later in this chapter. Remote
IDP name assigns an IdP name which will be used to identify in Unity the data provided by this import. Finally
the translation profile specifies the translation profile which is used to postprocess and effectively apply 
the raw result of user import.

In the following text available import implementations are described.

=== LDAP import

Import type:: +ldap+

LDAP import allows for fetching user information from LDAP server. The import works nearly exactly as remote 
LDAP authentication (see <<ldap-authenticator>>) the configuration is also the same. 

The main difference to regular authenticator is that +bindAs=user+ (what is the default value for the +bindAs+ 
parameter) is disallowed - during import there is no user's credential so binding must be performed with 
some system identity. Typically +bindAs=system+ is used, however in case of import it is also possible to use
anonymous connection to the LDAP server with +bindAs=none+.

It is possible to share configuration file of LDAP authenticator and LDAP import. The generic import settings
(+unity.userImport.*+) will be ignored by the authenticator.


=== Host OS import

Import type:: +hostOS+


This import option allows for importing information about users which are available in the host operating 
system. The system must be glibc based, and was tested with Linux only. See <<pam-authenticator>> for 
discussion of installation requirements. Besides the integration with the hosting OS this import option does
not require any additional, mechanism specific configuration. Therefore an example configuration can be:

----
unity.userImport.importerType=hostOS
unity.userImport.remoteIdpName=Local system
unity.userImport.inputTranslationProfile=pam-profile
----
